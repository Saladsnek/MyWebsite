# Elliot Lambert's Portfolio

## Age: 17

I am Elliot Lambert, I've had a passion for playing games for a while and that love for gaming has developed into wanting to develop games of my own. For a while, I have enjoyed expressing my creativity and find a lot of joy in developing stories and characters as a personal hobby of mine. It is my personal goal to be able to share these stories through games and to continue to explore themes of story telling I I have yet to explore. 

I love exploring both Sci-fi and Fantasy settings, both on their own and together, simply because they can provide an easy way to develop interesting worlds.

I enjoy playing games like World of Warcraft, Borderlands 2 and Fallout 4 as they provide engaging gameplay and interesting stories to go with them. These games offer unique themes that provoke questions and place you in the boots of the character you are playing as. This roleplaying aspect is what grabs me in these sorts of games.

I also have an interest in cartoons and animation, futhermore, a few years ago I completed my Silver Arts Award by using animation as a main part of it.

I know how to code a bit in C# and Python Idle but I want to learn Javascript and C++ as well.
